        <h3>First website launch</h3>
        <p>I just launched my first design of Kulkat's Collection. While I absolutely love that I *managed* to upload the website, it looks kind of awful. Will be having UI improvements soon</p>

        <h3>UI Overhaul in Progress</h3>
        <p>I am currently working on the UI after way too long. I added an About Me section to the original website a while back, and I'm actually really proud of it! The website still looks awful in my opinion, but at least the background isn't terrible anymore.</p>

        <h3> I absolutely hate dockers</h3>
        <p> I have been working on a VM for what feels like hours. I'm trying to get it to install Ngrok,</p>
        <p> But nothing I have tried has worked. As much as I want not to have to install Ngrok on my personal computer, I highly doubt that I will be able to avoid it. </p>
        <p>My server needs a PSU, and I am broke. Once I install Ngrok, I can link through miscellaneous stuff.</p>
        <p> I also promised to add parsec, and I don't go back on my promises unless they break the rules. Anyway, I HATE VMs.</p>

        <h3> Removing chat until I can get monitoring </h3>
        <p> Okay, which one of you guys decided to post a HACKING TUTORIAL IN CHAT? YALL GOT ME I.S.S. LIKE DUDE. COME ON. </p>

        <h3> THEY BLOCKED THE DOMAIN NAME</h3>
        <p> I have learned 2 equally upsetting and hilarious things:</p>
        <p> 1. They BLOCKED MY DOMAIN NAME</p>
        <p> 2. They have blocked ANY INSTANCE OF MY DOMAIN NAME</p>
        <p> While I would love to say it, literally any mention of my domain name will get this page blocked until I change the name. I guess it's fair, SOMEONE posted a "How to hack something" on the chat, but blocking any instance is kind of overkill. Will be working on asking it to be unblocked, but IDK if I will be able to get it unblocked.</p>
