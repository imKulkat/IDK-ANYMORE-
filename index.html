      <h1>Welcome to Kulkat's Collection</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my website!</p>

      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h2>Hello! I am Kulkat11</h2>
        <h3>here's a little about me</h3>
        <p>If you're curious about why I haven't given my real name, I have 2 reasons</p>
        <p>Reason 1: I don't want to be found on the internet</p>
        <p>Reason 2: The websites, apps, and other stuff that I make will 110% annoy the school. better to be untraceable than to be in trouble </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>I absolutely love to code and mess with computers. I could spend all day talking about computers and code if I got the chance to.</p>
        <p>While I love to build apps and games and misc. web stuff, the school really dislikes it. By that I mean I am 110% against Go-Gaurdian.</p>
        <p>If anybody is curious, I am working on multiple projects as I type this. I have ADHD, so I just kinda do everything all at once. Not too fun, but I can focus long enough to get basic web stuff up.</p>
        <p>It isn't too hard to host your own website if that sounds entertaining to you. I put a TON of research into it, but you probably don't have to.</p>
        <p>I was able to purchase this domain (kulkats-server.onl) from a website called Porkbun. It was only about 12-ish dollars a year, but still. There are basic free options (DuckDNS, etc.) and they're really useful!</p>
        <P>If you have any questions about technology, website design, whatever, just reach out to me at kulkats.server@gmail.com. I will happily respond!</P>
        <p> </p>
        <p>If you want to request a website to be linked, yeah, me too, probably.</p>
        <p>The thing is, what I use to link the websites only works for websites that are *already* unblocked. As of right now, I don't have a functioning proxy, and don't plan on getting one. I have these websites already; I made them myself. If the school blocks them, then it's all over ig.</p>
        <p>Please don't use the AI to cheat on homework or schoolwork. That gives the district(s) a reason to block this website and hunt me down like steam support just to punish me. It's stupid.</p>
        <p>As long as the district decides not to take this website down, I can keep improving it and adding more resources.</p>
        <p>Also, I have a BuyMeACoffee link and a Patreon link. This is because I'M BROKE. Help me out if possible; if not, I totally understand. Here's the Patreon link:    patreon.com/KulkatsServer     </p>
        <p>I totally get not being able to support me. It's fine. Just enjoy and hope this stays up for more than 3 days.</p>

        <h3>First website launch</h3>
        <p>I just launched my first design of Kulkat's Collection. While I absolutely love that I *managed* to upload the website, it looks kind of awful. Will be having UI improvements soon</p>

        <h3>UI Overhaul in Progress</h3>
        <p>I am currently working on the UI after way too long. I added an About Me section to the original website a while back, and I'm actually really proud of it! The website still looks awful in my opinion, but at least the background isn't terrible anymore.</p>
